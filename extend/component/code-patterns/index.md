Code Patterns are a special type of [component](/extend/component/). They
 
- **generate code** for [transformations](https://help.keboola.com/transformations/#new-transformations),
- implement the [generate action](/extend/component/code-patterns/interface#generate-action), and
- use the [configuration format](/extend/component/code-patterns/interface#configuration-format).

The generated code is written in a specific [output format](/extend/component/code-patterns/interface#output-format).
