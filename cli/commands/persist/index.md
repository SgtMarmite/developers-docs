```
kbc persist [flags]
```

Propagate changes in the local directory to the manifest. When you manually create a configuration or a row (e.g., by 
copy & paste of another existing configuration), the command will add its record to the manifest and generate a new ID. 
When you delete a configuration/row directory, the command will remove its record from the manifest. If you want 
to propagate the changes to the project, call the [push](/cli/commands/push/) command afterwards.

## Options

`--dry-run`
: Preview all changes

[Global Options](/cli/commands/#global-options)

## Examples

When you copy & paste a directory of a MySQL extractor configuration, the command will look like this:

```
➜ kbc persist --dry-run
Plan for "persist" operation:
  + C main/extractor/keboola.ex-db-mysql/invoices 2
  + R main/extractor/keboola.ex-db-mysql/invoices 2/rows/customer
Dry run, nothing changed.
Persist done.
```
