Push configurations from the local directory to the project in Keboola Connection. Its state will be overwritten 
to match the local state.

: Delete configurations missing in the local directory

[Global Options](/cli/commands/#global-options)

## Example

When you [create a configuration](/cli/commands/create-config/) of the MySQL extractor, the command will look like this:

```
➜ kbc push --dry-run

Plan for "push" operation:
  + C main/extractor/keboola.ex-db-mysql/7511990/invoices
  + R main/extractor/keboola.ex-db-mysql/7511990/invoices/rows/customer
Dry run, nothing changed.
Push done.
```
