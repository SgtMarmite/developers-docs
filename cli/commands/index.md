## Options 

Options can be passed to each command from environment variables. In that case, the starting `--` becomes `KBC_`,
all letters are changed to uppercase and dashes to underscores, e.g., the option `--log-file` becomes `KBC_LOG_FILE`.

You can also put the environment variables to [.env files](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#what-other-env-files-can-i-use).

Reading the options by commands takes this priority:

1. Command-line flags
2. Environment variables from the OS environment
3. Environment variables from .env files in the working directory
4. Environment variables from .env files in the project directory

## Global Options

`-h, --help`
: Show help for the command

`-l, --log-file <string>`
: Path to a log file to store the details in

`-t, --storage-api-token <string>`
: Storage API token to the project

`-v, --verbose`
: Increase output verbosity

`--verbose-api`
: Log each API request and its response

`-V, --version`
: Show the version

`-d, --working-dir <string>`
